Note: Christy
Introduce selves. We're happy to be back at UW GIS Day again talking about community education using open source geospatial technology and this great group called maptime Seattle. 


## Overview
[maptimesea.github.io/gis-day-2015/](http://maptimesea.github.io/gis-day-2015/)

Note: Christy 
Here's a quick overview about what we'll be talking about.


## a year in review

Note: Christy
Last year MaptimeSeattle was just getting going, but now we're 1 year old! So we're excited to share with you what we've accmomplished this year.


## Maptime Around the World

Note: Christy
We'll also tell you about how maptime has spread thoughout the world and its global context.


## Where we are Headed

Note: Christy
We'll let you know what we've got in store for 2016.


## Where you fit In

Note: Christy
And finally, how you can get involved, and we can learn new things together!



## What is MaptimeSEA

_free technology workshops_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

_free and open source technology_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

_everything we do targets beginners_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note: Andrew raise your hand if you've used a map? raise your hand if you've made a map? Raise your hand if you are an educator? Raise hand if you're a student? have you heard of maptime? Been to a maptime? raise your hand if you want to learn new things? do you use foss on a daily basis?


## Talk is cheap

_In the last year we..._ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->


### grew from 3 to 307


### hosted 10 workshops


### mapped for Humanitarian Open Street Map


### facilitated project nights


### advocated for beginners...

## Our Focus

_beginners_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

_Free and Open Source Software_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note: Christy
The focus of our group like Andrew said, is beginners! And anyone else! We welcome people of any skill level who have an interest in learing open source mapping technologies. We want our workshops to be accessible to all. We do not assume any existing skill set, and strive to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for all.
In the same vain, we use free software. We think that no one should have to purchase software just to learn something new, and that they should be able to take work home and practice more. So our workshops use software anyone can download free of charge.


## What is FOSS?
Note: Christy
Free and open source software is free, as in its free of charge. And it is also open, as in the source code is accessible to all. Users are encouraged to contribute, fix bugs, implement new features and the like.


## Is FOSS for Beginners?

_we're a little biased..._ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

_but the answer is YES!_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

_although it can be slightly more complicated_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note: Christy
Fix bugs? Implement new features? That sounds really hard. Open source software can be more difficult to begin using, but we think with the right environment, FOSS can definitely be for beginners.


## The Practice and Perception

_FOSS is created by experts for experts_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->


## Our Goal

Make FOSS more accessible to beginners through education and participation in FOSS design/direction!



## How is this Relevant?

Note: Andrew


## Where we Come From (academically)


## Where we Come From (professionally)


## Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source

[cugos.org](http://cugos.org/)

Note: Engage the local community


## So then there was MaptimeSEA!



## Go Global


## Maptime Around the World


## Early Origins


## Stats

Note: Give out a sticker prize to the person who gets closest to the estimate

## Highlight Awesome Projects



## What can this community do?

Note: Christy
The community aspect is a big deal. Together we can make things change!


## Support Beginners in FOSS

Note: Christy
We can help beginners learn to use FOSS and expand their arsenal of tools.


## Advocate in established forums

Note: Christy
We can promote openness and accessibilty in exisintg forums.


## Mobilize for good

HOT OSM

Note: Christy
We can give back by mobilizing when their is a crisis. We used the skills we learned on how to contribute to open street map to add buildings and roads after the major Nepal earthquake. You may not feel up to contributing code fixes and functionality, but this is another way to give back.



## What comes next

Note: Christy
We've got some great stuff coming up in 2016. 


## QGIS series

Note: Christy
We're developing q series of workshops on QGIS. QGIS, if you haven't heard of it, is a desktop mapping application like ArcMap, but its free and open source. Its a complex program, so we'll be doing 2 hour sessions on using different parts of it to do different things such as geocoding, working with raster data, using the python window, etc.


## Project Nights

Note: Christy
Our project nights have been wildly successful, so we're planning on doing a lot more of those. Not only is it less work for the organizers, but it turns out a lot of people just want to learn something new and need the environment to do so. Other things you can do are install different software, or reformat something you did for work that your boss won't give you time to do. 


## More Volunteer Instructors
Note: Christy
We're also looking to get more volunteer instructors to give workshops. There are a lot of people in the community with great skills that I'm sure they are eager to teach to our maptime group. Teaching a workshop is also a great way to solidify your own knowledge of something. I know I was no expert on the QGIS and tiling workshops that I taught before agreeing to it. But we did it together!


## Reusable Tutorial Development

Note: Christy
We'll also be working on building reusable tutorials. We can share these with other maptime groups or encourage people to work on them even if they can't make it to the maptime event.



## Call to Action

Note: Andrew
Where do you come in?


## Get Involved

_volunteer to instruct_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

_host an event in your space_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

_participate in our open learning community!_ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
